The Action Group List is a reference window which is designed to be kept on the screen or opened and closed as needed so you do not have to remember all of your action group assignments.  This list will expand vertically until it reaches it's cap.	The settings menu allows you to adjust various visual elements of Action Group Manager as well as confirm the version of AGM that you are running and ignore respecting the Career mode building upgrades.
 

Tweakable UI

The Tweakable UI is feature of Action Group Manager which allows your to assign your action groups through a drill down-style menu by right clicking the part you want to assign.  To use it, first right click the root part of your vessel and choose the AGM : Enable option.  From there you can right click any part with actions and follow the drill down menu to assign your action.  This feature operates independently of the other AGM windows, however it may also be used in conjunction with them.
